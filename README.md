# Fractured_polymer_image_classification_by_fine-tuning_Deep_CNNs

The task was to classify fractured polymer images on their infill percentage [20, 40, 60, 80]. Basically, I employed techniques like fine-tuning to Neural Network architectures like Vision Trnsformers (ViT-b/16), ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, EfficientNet-B0, to predict the density (can be considered analogus to infill percentage) of a given polymer using the images of the fractured polymer samples.
